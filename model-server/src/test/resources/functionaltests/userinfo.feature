#  Scenario: No email to get when not logged
#    Given the server has been started with in-memory storage

#
#  Scenario: No email to get when logged
#    # the token should expire in year 2286

#     When I visit "/getEmail" with header "Authorization" set to "Bearer mySpectacularToken"
#     Then I should get an OK response
