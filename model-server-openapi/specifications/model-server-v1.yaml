          description: >
            A URI reference that uniquely identifies the problem type only in the
            context of the provided API. Opposed to the specification in RFC-9457,
            it is neither recommended to be dereferenceable and point to a
            human-readable documentation nor globally unique for the problem type.
          default: 'about:blank'
          example: '/some/uri-reference'
        title:
          type: string
          description: >
            A short summary of the problem type. Written in English and readable
            for engineers, usually not suited for non technical stakeholders and
            not localized.
          example: some title for the error situation
        status:
          type: integer
          format: int32
          description: >
            The HTTP status code generated by the origin server for this occurrence

        detail:
          type: string
          description: >
            A human readable explanation specific to this occurrence of the
            problem that is helpful to locate the problem and give advice on how
            to proceed. Written in English and readable for engineers, usually not
            suited for non technical stakeholders and not localized.
          example: some description for the error situation
        instance:
          type: string
          format: uri-reference
          description: >
            A URI reference that identifies the specific occurrence of the problem,
            e.g. by adding a fragment identifier or sub-path to the problem type.
            May be used to locate the root of this problem in the source code.
          example: '/some/uri-reference#specific-occurrence-context'
