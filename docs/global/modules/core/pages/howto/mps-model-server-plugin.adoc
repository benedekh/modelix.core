= How-To run the light `model-server` in MPS as plugin
:navtitle: mps-model-server-plugin


You can run a *light version* of the `model-server` directly in MPS via the dedicated *MPS as Modelix Model Server Plugin*, which is published over at the https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/22834-mps-as-modelix-model-server[JetBrains Marketplace^].

NOTE: More information on the component in general can be found in the xref:core:reference/component-mps-model-server-plugin.adoc[corresponding component reference].

[IMPORTANT]
====
A light model-server does not provide the full features as an independent `model-server` instance will.
More *advanced features* will not work with this light version (e.g. modelix specific repositories/branches, or the xref:howto/metrics.adoc[metrics]).

If you want the full capabilities of the `model-server`, check out xref:howto/usage-model-api-gen-gradle.adoc[how to start it standalone].

== How to Install the Plugin

In MPS navigate to File -> Settings -> Plugins (left) -> Marketplace (top) -> Search for "modelix model server" -> Press *Install* -> Press *Restart IDE*.

You can access the light `model-server` via the

== How to Run the Plugin

Once you restart MPS, the light `model-server` will start automatically with MPS.
There are no graphical user interfaces, but to verify you can check the MPS log for

[source,bash]
--
starting modelix server

The `model-server` will run by default on port `48305`.

If you want to find out how connect a client and send queries to the plugin, have a look at the xref:howto/modelql.adoc[ModelQL documentation] or the xref:core:reference/component-mps-model-server-plugin.adoc[component reference].
