:navtitle: Use the `light-model-client`


NOTE: If you are interested in a more practical usage of what is presented here, check out the https://github.com/modelix/modelix.samples[samples project^]


Creating an instance that loads the entire model from the server can be done like this:

[source,kotlin]
--
val client = LightModelClient.builder()
    .url("ws://localhost/json/v2/test-repo/ws") // optional, by default it connects to the MPS plugin
    .build()
--

You have to set a *model query* using `changeQuery()` to tell the server in what data you are interested in.

CAUTION: Without a query the client will not receive any data.

[source,kotlin]
--
client.changeQuery(buildModelQuery {
    root {
        descendants {  }
    }
})
--

To read or write any nodes you have to start a read/write transaction by using `runRead {}`/`runWrite {}`.
An exception is thrown when you try to access a node outside a transaction.

[source,kotlin]
--
val rootNode = client.waitForRootNode()!!
client.runRead {
    val modules = rootNode.getChildren("modules")
    // ...
}
--

CAUTION: If you try to access a node that is not included in your *model query* an exception is thrown.

You can use `INode.isLoaded()` to check if a node was loaded on the client to prevent this exception.
You can also filter a list of nodes like this: `node.getChildren("modules").filterLoaded()`, to iterate only over the nodes that are included in your query.
